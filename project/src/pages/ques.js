      What is the best time to travel to India?
      </label>
      <div className="tab-content">
      The diverse topography of India comprises mountains, beaches, and deserts. The large size of the country also blesses it with different climatic conditions, which means that, while some places in India may have the mercury rising in the summers, there are some, where the weather is cool and pleasant. Therefore, the best time to travel to India depends on the places a tourist would like to visit in the country. However, it is also safe to say that the winter season (October - March) is mostly preferred by the tourists while visiting India.

For wildlife sightings, both summer (March-mid June) and winter seasons are favourable. While the winter season is best for sighting animals basking in the sun during the day time, summer is the time when they can be seen frequently paying a visit to the water holes

      What kind of clothes do I need to carry while traveling in India ?
      </label>
      <div className="tab-content">
      Since India experiences hot summers (in most of the parts) and chilly winters, travellers should pack according to the month they are planning a visit in. If the trip is planned in the months between March and September, carrying light woolens (in the hills) and cotton clothes (in other areas) will be enough. On the other hand, if the trip is scheduled between October and February, carrying heavy woollens for North India and light woollens for South India is advisable.
